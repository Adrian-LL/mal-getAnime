# mal-getAnime
Pyhton script for getting anime from MyAnimeList / forked from Dibakarroy1997/myanimelist-data-set-creator

* Modified the link to `jikan` API.
* Added some more fields to json
* Added utf-8 encoding to output file

# TO DO
* to append to file instead of write (open('w')). To fiddle to check if the file exists etc.
* to get more fields from the MAL page (e.g japanese name etc. - only if useful)
